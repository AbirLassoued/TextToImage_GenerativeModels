## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TextToImage_GenerativeModels.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd TextToImage_GenerativeModels
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

## Sample Outputs
Below are examples of images generated from text prompts:
- Prompt: "A sunset over a mountain range"
  - Output: ![Sunset over mountains](images/generated_samples/sunset_mountains.png)
- Prompt: "A futuristic city skyline at night"
  - Output: ![Futuristic city](images/generated_samples/futuristic_city.png)

## Learning Journey
As part of this project, the team completed the "Prompt Engineering for Generative AI" course on LinkedIn Learning and conducted extensive research through books and online resources.

## Acknowledgments
We extend our gratitude to **Mr. Sofien Boutaib**, whose innovative teaching approach provided invaluable insights into the practical applications of Generative AI.

## Future Directions
This project is a stepping stone towards more advanced applications of generative AI. Future work could explore:
